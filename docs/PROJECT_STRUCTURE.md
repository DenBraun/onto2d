Dependencies point inward. `@onto2d/kernel` has no package dependencies and
must not import adapters, filesystem code, UI code, catalogue formats, or
scientific implementations. Schemas describe transport shapes; runtime code
still verifies cross-record and semantic invariants.

`@onto2d/engine` is catalogue-independent. A facade or application supplies
verified Model Packs; the private root facade supplies the current canonical
Causal Emergence graph.

## Boundary rules

- Source data in `references/` is not edited to satisfy an audit.
- The CLI composes public loader and engine APIs; it does not bypass pack verification.
- Directory, ZIP, and HTTP transport metadata never changes Model Pack semantic identity.
- Cache records are verified before use; storage and eviction metadata never
  changes Model Pack semantic identity.
- Registry selection is explicit and its paths remain below the registry
  origin; registry metadata never changes Model Pack semantic identity.
- A registry-backed application may list releases only from a validated,
  hash-pinned snapshot and must re-verify the selected pack before activation.
- External source facts, deterministic derivations, and project analysis use
  distinct records and identities; counterfactual edges never enter extracted
  upstream evidence or an upstream/derived-only Model Pack.
- External case overview pages may describe planned work, but must expose its
  status and must not present a plan, expected output, or flagship experiment
  as a completed result.
- Cases may call the kernel but must not add case-specific branches to it.
- Scientific solvers may implement adapter contracts but must not import the kernel.
- Applications do not become authorities for scientific values or canonical
  identity; they project disclosed models or tested artifacts.
- View layouts are derived presentation output and never enter model identity.
- Structural geometry consumes complete verified Model Packs, retains source
  interpretation, and binds derived policies and results separately from source
  identity. It never writes shadow metric values back into source relations.
- The implemented distinguishability/probe/comparison layers stay in the existing
  structural-geometry package. Their scientific descriptors are separate from
  provenance identity; missing observations are not equality, and a filtration
  or typed channel is not automatically a length metric.
- Lazy presentation may omit non-visible records, but complete semantic
  execution must use a fully materialized and verified Model Pack.
- RDF import preserves RDF terms and predicates without assigning Onto2D
  levels, relation kinds, causality, or Model Pack readiness. Crossing that
  boundary requires a separate reviewed mapping policy.
- Blank-node identities are local to one exact RDF source hash and never merge
  implicitly across imports.
- SHACL validation binds exact data and shapes imports, performs only its
  declared Core constraints and class traversal, and never implies an
  RDF-to-Onto2D semantic mapping.
- RDF mapping consumes only exact imports and a conforming exact SHACL report;
  its policy carries both source IDs and all exact input hashes, declares
  source, level, class, relation, and omission policy, and accounts for every
  source statement before building a Model Pack.
- Model Pack indexes are derived accelerators and never authority over the
  canonical model files.
- Operational metadata such as timestamps and resource use does not enter
  semantic hashes.
- Generated run output belongs in ignored `runs/`; only reviewed fixtures are
  committed.
- A neutral tool must not import the engine or acquire case-specific analysis
  vocabulary merely because one case is its first consumer.

Update the relevant architecture guide when a change affects canonical identity,
evidence semantics, scientific trust boundaries or dependency direction.
