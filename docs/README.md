# Documentation

Onto2D is in development, before its first project release. These documents
describe current contracts, evidence and planned work.

## Documentation ownership

Each subject has one authoritative guide. Package READMEs explain local API
entrypoints; case READMEs own source provenance, reproduction and interpretation;
app READMEs own operation of the interface. They link to shared contracts rather
than duplicate them. The roadmap owns priorities and status, not API definitions.

A frozen experiment protocol beside its source lock is a scientific input.
Preserve its bytes when a checksum binds it, even when a later study asks a new
question. Publish the new study with its own protocol. Keep actual negative
results, source limitations, attribution and reproducibility instructions.

Update the relevant guide for a contract change. Create a new document only for
a distinct owner or a separately frozen experimental input; do not add a new
ADR, review report, revision analysis or implementation-stage diary.
