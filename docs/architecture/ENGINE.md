```

`@onto2d/engine` is a headless, catalogue-independent facade. It resolves an
exact Model Pack before exposing a model. The repository root facade bundles
the current canonical research reconstruction and the historical Causal
Emergence snapshot, and provides `stable` and `latest`
aliases for convenience; the root package remains private while this preview
API is reviewed.

```js
import { Onto2D } from "onto2d";

const engine = await Onto2D.create();
const model = engine.model;
const node = model.require("R-object");
const parents = model.parents(node.id);
```

The model API provides immutable reads, deterministic filtering, parent and
child traversal, ancestors, descendants, bounded neighborhoods, and bounded
all-shortest directed paths. It does not assign new scientific meaning to
source relations.

The current default is `causal-emergence@2026.09.14.31`, a partial research
reconstruction. `stable` identifies the bundled software artifact, not
scientific confirmation. Select `causal-emergence@2026.08.15` explicitly for
the historical 249-record catalogue and its original source-parent semantics.

The root facade also registers `canonical-identity`. It calls the kernel's
canonicalizer and returns a replayable artifact bound to the exact selected
Model Pack; it does not duplicate canonicalization logic.

<a id="engine-and-model-pack-architecture--command-line-composition"></a>

### Command-line composition

`@onto2d/cli` is a separate read-only operational package. Its `verify`
command uses the `@onto2d/model-pack/node` source loader for either a split
directory or a ZIP file; model queries first obtain that verified pack and then
call the public `@onto2d/engine` API. The CLI never imports the kernel, reads
semantic files around the loader, repairs a pack, extracts an archive onto the
filesystem, or writes into the source.

Successful commands emit a versioned deterministic JSON envelope. CLI output
is an operational projection, not a Model Pack file, semantic artifact, cache,
or new model identity. Usage failures, rejected data, and internal failures
have distinct stable exit codes.

`@onto2d/view` is a separate dependency-free presentation boundary. It accepts
explicit node and edge arrays and returns catalogue, bounded neighborhood, and
SVG-ready layout projections. It does not authenticate packs, import the
engine, or place coordinates in semantic hashes. The static Model Studio asks
a dedicated worker to authenticate the complete bundled release, then passes
only the verified node and edge arrays into this view layer. If worker startup
or transport fails, Studio runs the same strict browser verifier on the main
thread; a Model Pack data failure is never converted into a fallback success.

<a id="engine-and-model-pack-architecture--model-pack-contract"></a>

### Model Pack contract

A transparent Model Pack contains a manifest plus canonical JSON files for
nodes, edges, dictionaries, and rebuilt indexes. Verification rejects missing,
extra, stale, or hash-mismatched content.

- `rootHash` identifies semantic model content, compatibility, and exact source.
- `manifestHash` also binds release metadata and derived indexes.
- indexes are accelerators only; verification rebuilds them from model files.
- aliases resolve to an exact model version before a `Model` is returned.

Node.js applications may load the transparent split format through
`@onto2d/model-pack/node`. The bounded directory loader accepts only the known
JSON layout and rejects links, unexpected entries, invalid UTF-8, invalid JSON,
resource-limit violations, stale indexes, and hash drift.

The same subpath accepts a strict single-disk ZIP32 transport containing the
identical root-relative layout. Only stored and Deflate entries are supported.
The loader checks central and local metadata, entry types, CRC-32, UTF-8, JSON,
required and unexpected paths, per-entry compressed and uncompressed sizes,
total expansion, and compression ratio before normal Model Pack verification.
It rejects duplicate entries, links, encryption, data descriptors, ZIP64,
alternative path metadata, non-contiguous records, and changed archive bytes.
ZIP encoding and transport metadata do not enter `rootHash` or `manifestHash`;
only the verified extracted Model Pack does. The ZIP loader does not fetch
remote content.

Browser applications may use `@onto2d/model-pack/browser`. Its HTTP directory
loader accepts one explicit absolute HTTP(S) base URL and requests only the
fixed required JSON paths. Credentials in the URL, query strings, fragments,
redirects, opaque responses, response-URL drift, non-JSON media types,
malformed `Content-Length`, invalid UTF-8 or JSON, and per-file or cumulative
stream-limit violations fail closed. A valid declared length is used as an
early transport bound, but is not compared with the decoded Fetch stream:
CDNs may report compressed transfer bytes while Fetch exposes decompressed
content. An optional required `bundle.json` must reproduce the authoritative
split files exactly. The same entrypoint accepts bounded raw JSON bundle bytes
or a `Blob`; it does not interpret ZIP data.

The browser verifier reaches kernel identity only through the narrow
`@onto2d/kernel/canonical` entrypoint. That entrypoint contains the same
canonicalization and synchronous SHA-256 behavior as the full kernel without
loading Node-only Oracle or graph modules into the browser module graph.

Both browser sources feed the normal Model Pack verifier. URL layout, transfer
chunking, response headers, and the choice between split files and bundle bytes
do not enter model identity. The adapter performs no alias resolution,
discovery, retries, persistent caching, registry access, or automatic repair.
Persistent caching is a separate caller-selected layer and does not weaken
this source contract.

`@onto2d/model-pack/worker` adds a versioned plain-data protocol over that
browser source contract. Its client owns request identifiers, pending-request
limits, timeouts, `AbortSignal` cancellation, optional explicit buffer
transfer, listener cleanup, and stable remote errors. Its endpoint validates a
closed message shape before calling the browser loader, bounds concurrent work,
and aborts active HTTP requests on cancellation. Worker results are
structured-cloned; the client validates and freezes the result envelope while
trusting the same-origin endpoint to have performed full reconstruction and
hash verification.

Document import maps do not apply inside workers. Model Studio therefore loads
a committed self-contained worker asset generated from a small modular
entrypoint. `npm run check:worker` rebuilds it in memory and rejects stale
generated bytes. This deployment artifact changes neither the Model Pack
format nor `rootHash`, `manifestHash`, or kernel canonical identity.

`@onto2d/model-pack/cache` adds a storage-neutral verified cache above the
browser verifier. A caller must supply the expected exact `rootHash` and
`manifestHash`; the manifest hash determines the cache key and both hashes are
checked after full verification. A record contains only canonical Model Pack
JSON. Every read is parsed, reconstructed, hashed, and compared with the
expected identity before it can become a hit. Every candidate is verified
again before an atomic storage commit. Invalid or non-canonical records are
removed and reported as recovery misses, never returned as model data.

The package provides in-memory and IndexedDB storage adapters. Public limits
bound entries, each record, total bytes, database names, and storage scans.
Eviction is deterministic first-in-first-out by a persisted insertion ordinal;
wall-clock time, access recency, HTTP metadata, and IndexedDB metadata do not
affect model identity. Concurrent loads for the same exact identity share one
operation. Closing, clearing, and removing records wait for relevant active
loads, and storage ownership is explicit.

Model Studio uses the IndexedDB adapter as an optional performance layer. A
cached bundle is still sent through the worker verifier before presentation;
the direct browser verifier remains the worker-transport fallback. IndexedDB
availability or operational failure may bypass caching, but malformed Model
Pack data, hash drift, and an unexpected exact identity remain hard failures.
Neither a cache hit nor a cache recovery changes the verified pack exposed to
the view layer.

`@onto2d/model-pack/registry` is a read-only discovery boundary above these
transports. A version-1 registry is a bounded flat list keyed by an explicit
`modelId` and `version`; aliases, ranges, implicit latest selection, retries,
and mutation are not part of the contract. Each entry supplies exact
`rootHash` and `manifestHash` values plus an ASCII relative directory path.
The resolved pack URL must remain on the registry origin and below its
directory.

Registry JSON is fetched without credentials, redirects, referrer data, or
HTTP caching and is subject to strict response identity, media type, UTF-8,
JSON, byte, entry, path, and URL limits. Normalized entries receive a
domain-separated `registryHash`. Callers may pin that hash; an unpinned result
is explicitly marked `transport-only`. Registry resolution does not verify a
Model Pack. The separate matcher binds a previously verified pack to the
resolved model ID, version, root hash, and manifest hash.

Model Studio pins the committed registry hash, resolves its explicit release,
then passes the resolution URL to the existing worker/cache composition. Both
network candidates and cached records must match the complete resolution
before storage or presentation. The repository registry check also verifies
every indexed `bundle.json` and rejects a stale Studio pin.

`@onto2d/view/lazy` adds an exact-identity presentation session after full
verification. Its descriptor, catalogue pages, node details, and neighborhood
projections all carry the same model ID, version, root hash, and manifest hash.
Catalogue rows and graph projections omit complete source records; the full
record is returned only by explicit node inspection. Page sizes, relation
summaries, graph size, nesting, input shape, and session lifetime are bounded.
These projections are read-only presentation envelopes, not semantic
artifacts or partial model executions.

`@onto2d/engine/presentation` is the verified bridge. It re-verifies a complete
Model Pack, optionally matches all four coordinates of a registry resolution,
then creates the presentation session from its canonical nodes and edges.
`@onto2d/view` remains dependency-free and does not authenticate caller data.
Model Studio composes the bridge only after registry, worker, and cache checks,
initially materializes 60 catalogue rows, and requests later pages, bounded
neighborhoods, and full node records separately.

Model Pack v1 is not a chunked semantic format.
The current split files are still all required for verification, and complete
analysis still requires a fully materialized verified source population.
The [Model Pack v2 proposal](../model-pack-v2/README.md) specifies physical ID-ordered
chunks and manifest-bound optional artifacts, with distinct partial-inspection
and complete-analysis gates. Its draft schemas and examples do not change this
implemented v1 contract. Adoption requires format review, explicit version
dispatch and new release hashes; semantic subgraph slicing remains deferred.

<a id="engine-and-model-pack-architecture--external-rdf-import"></a>

### External RDF import

`@onto2d/rdf-import` is a separate browser-safe adapter for the stable
[RDF 1.1 N-Triples Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/). It does
not claim conformance to every N-Triples document. Its versioned safe profile
accepts a bounded line-oriented subset: absolute IRIs, RDF 1.1 blank nodes,
simple, language, and datatype literals, comments, LF or CRLF, and ASCII
lexical transport with non-ASCII values expressed through Unicode escapes.

The adapter deliberately rejects relative IRIs, BOMs, malformed UTF-8, Turtle
directives, RDF/XML, and the `VERSION`, triple-term, and directional-language
features described by the current
[RDF 1.2 N-Triples Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-n-triples/).
Choosing the stable RDF 1.1 Recommendation prevents a draft syntax from
silently changing the import contract.

Every import artifact binds the exact source bytes, source identifier,
normalized RDF terms, unique statements, and duplicate line occurrences.
`graphHash` identifies the normalized statement set. `importHash` additionally
binds exact source provenance. Blank-node term IDs include the exact source
hash as their scope, so labels never create identity across documents. This is
an import-local identity, not blank-node graph canonicalization or an RDF
isomorphism algorithm.

The optional neutral graph projection uses subjects and objects as nodes and
the RDF predicate as an uninterpreted edge label. It performs no network
dereferencing, RDFS or OWL inference, source classification, or Onto2D
level/relation assignment. It does not build a Model Pack. SHACL validation is
a separate consumer of the exact import artifact, not an import side effect.
The separate mapping package described below is the only implemented crossing
from imported RDF statements to Model Pack records; a schema-valid RDF import
alone is never evidence for such a mapping.

<a id="engine-and-model-pack-architecture--closed-shacl-validation"></a>

### Closed SHACL validation

`@onto2d/shacl-validation` implements profile
`shacl10-core-structural-v1` over two verified RDF imports: one data graph and
one shapes graph. The profile follows the stable
[SHACL 1.0 Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) and deliberately does
not adopt features from the current
[SHACL 1.2 Core Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl12-core/).

The shapes import is compiled into an immutable plan that binds its exact
source, graph, and import hashes. The supported Core surface is explicit node
and property shapes, the four standard target forms, one IRI predicate path,
and min-count, max-count, datatype, node-kind, and class constraints. Severity,
messages, and deactivation are preserved. Datatype constraints accept a
declared lexical subset; a matching datatype IRI with an ill-typed lexical form
still produces a result.

Class targets and class constraints require SHACL type semantics. The validator
therefore follows explicit `rdf:type` values and cycle-safe
`rdfs:subClassOf*` paths inside the exact data artifact. This traversal is
bounded and permits IRI class nodes only. It is not external entailment,
general RDFS closure, OWL reasoning, graph repair, or a new RDF graph identity.

The resulting JSON report binds the exact data import, shapes import, and plan.
Results have content identities and deterministic order; `conforms` is false
whenever at least one result exists, including a warning or information
result. A result-limit overflow fails without returning a partial report.
Verifiers recompute the complete plan or report and compare canonical content.

The profile fails closed on unsupported shape predicates, implicit shape
typing, complex paths, custom targets, lists and logical constraints, SPARQL,
JavaScript, rules, draft features, network access, and non-IRI class edges. A
valid report establishes only conformance to this RDF structural profile. It
does not assign Onto2D levels, relation roles, causality, Historical Load,
scientific status, or Model Pack identity.

<a id="engine-and-model-pack-architecture--reviewed-rdf-to-onto2d-mapping"></a>

### Reviewed RDF-to-Onto2D mapping

`@onto2d/rdf-mapping` implements profile
`rdf-to-model-pack-explicit-v1`. It accepts only verified RDF data and shapes
imports, an exact replayable SHACL report with `conforms: true`, and a canonical
policy bound to all three input identities. The mapping remains outside both
the generic importer and validator.

The first profile makes every semantic choice explicit. Entities are IRIs with
one directly asserted mapped `rdf:type`; no subclass inference participates in
entity selection. Source IRIs remain node IDs. One constant level, its meaning,
class-to-`typeRole` and `scientificStatus` rules, one optional label predicate,
and directed predicate-to-relation rules are all policy fields. Mapped classes
and predicates must also have active coverage in the exact SHACL plan.

Every source statement must resolve to exactly one `node-type`, `node-label`,
`edge`, or `ignored` disposition. An ignored predicate requires a review reason
and its statement ID remains in the mapping audit. Node records preserve RDF
term, class-statement, and label-statement identities; edge records preserve
their source statement and predicate. The policy input binding includes the
data and shapes source IDs as well as their import hashes and the validation
report hash. Raw files plus policy are therefore replayable without hidden
source-ID configuration. The policy itself contains source URI, version,
license, and adaptation provenance and enters `policyHash`.

The mapping artifact and generated Model Pack are deterministic. The pack uses
the exact RDF source hashes, places `mappingHash` in `source.auditHash`, and
retains the complete policy and statement accounting in its dictionaries.
Runtime verification replays import, SHACL validation, mapping, and normal
Model Pack construction. JSON Schema validation alone is never trusted.

The public reference under `cases/rdf-mapping-reference` adapts the W3C SHACL
Person and Company example into a conforming closed-profile fixture. Its level
0 means only a flat external source layer. It is not kernel Level 0, Historical
Load zero, or evidence of formation. The fixture proves the boundary and is not
a general RDF ontology mapper, a W3C conformance test, or an independently
reviewed scientific dataset.

<a id="engine-and-model-pack-architecture--state-and-comparison"></a>

### State and comparison

Each `Workspace` owns independent model instances and explicit run bindings.
A referenced model cannot be removed, and a changed root hash cannot replace
an existing exact version. Structural diff reports added, removed, and changed
nodes and edges. Without a registered record it reports lineage as
`not-declared`. A declared lineage record binds both exact release identities,
has its own hash, and is accepted only when every event is supported by the
actual diff. Similar labels or identifiers never create implicit lineage.

<a id="engine-and-model-pack-architecture--boundaries"></a>

### Boundaries

This boundary excludes kernel semantics, a UI framework, mutable registry
operations, registry aliases, RDF/XML or Turtle import, unrestricted SHACL,
OWL reasoning, automatic ontology mapping, empirical Historical Load values,
physical semantic chunking, or a fabricated second release for Studio
comparison. Registry trust, cache limits, storage selection, presentation page
limits, RDF import, SHACL, and mapping limits, and failure fallback are explicit
application policy, not verifier behavior.
Analyses must be registered explicitly.
Deferred engineering work is listed in the
[Engine Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md); scientific dependencies remain in the
[Scientific Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).

<a id="model-pack-and-engine-foundation"></a>

## Model Pack and Engine Foundation

Two packages provide the model boundary:

- `@onto2d/model-pack` builds and verifies transparent, canonical Model Packs;
- `@onto2d/engine` exposes exact-version model access, traversal, workspaces,
  registered analyses, and structural diff without embedding a catalogue.

The private root facade composes the generic engine with the current canonical
graph and the original catalogue used by research cases. `rootHash` binds semantic files, compatibility, and exact
source; `manifestHash` additionally binds release metadata and derived indexes.
Indexes are always rebuilt during verification.

Canonical relations retain their declared descriptive or functional-support
roles and evidence scope. Diff reports lineage as undeclared unless an explicit
lineage record is supplied.

<a id="lineage-local-loading-and-first-registered-analysis"></a>

## Lineage, Local Loading, and First Registered Analysis

- Define content-addressed lineage sidecars that bind ordered model IDs,
  versions, and semantic root hashes. Registration and diff replay reject
  nonexistent entities, reversed releases, stale hashes, and events unsupported
  by the structural change.
- Keep lineage outside the Model Pack root contract for now. Binding a record
  into a future pack manifest is deferred until a real second release establishes
  the required direction and packaging needs without a self-referential root.
- Add bounded transparent-directory loading only under
  `@onto2d/model-pack/node`; keep the main verifier and engine browser-safe.
- Publish Canonical Identity as an analysis package that calls the existing
  kernel operation. The root facade registers it by default and the static lab
  remains a projection of frozen fixtures.

<a id="deterministic-view-boundary-and-initial-studio"></a>

## Deterministic View Boundary and Initial Studio

- Add dependency-free `@onto2d/view`. It validates explicit JSON node and edge
  arrays and produces deterministic catalogue, bounded neighborhood, and
  SVG-ready layout projections.
- Keep the package free of DOM, filesystem, engine, and hashing dependencies.
  Coordinates and routes are derived output and never affect model identity.
- Add a static Model Studio that reads the transparent Causal Emergence release,
  checks its declared identity and counts, and exposes search, filters, local
  graph navigation, and exact source-record inspection.
- Version comparison requires two exact model releases and explicit reviewed
  lineage for lineage claims. Browser checks do not replace authoritative
  Model Pack verification.

<a id="external-level-0-phase-b-solver-boundary"></a>

## External Level-0 Phase-B solver boundary

The unchanged `onto2d-level-0-reference-solver@1.0.0` method is owned by
`@onto2d/level-zero-solver`. The package depends only on
`@onto2d/scientific-adapter`; it does not import the kernel. The case owns the
model, source lock, Oracle request construction, validation, and frozen result.

The solver rejects invalid, mismatched, unsupported, and resource-exceeding
requests with distinct structured error codes. Grid, mode, quantity, and
evidence counts are bounded before numerical work begins. The existing
request, response, and analysis identities remain unchanged because moving an
implementation does not change its declared algorithm.

<a id="read-only-engine-cli-composition"></a>

## Read-only Engine CLI composition

`@onto2d/cli` exposes `verify`, `node`, `neighborhood`, and `paths`. `verify`
uses `@onto2d/model-pack/node`. Every model query loads the pack through that
same boundary and then calls `@onto2d/engine`; the CLI does not import the
kernel or inspect semantic files directly.

Commands are read-only. Successful results use JSON output schema `1`.
Argument errors exit `2`, rejected pack or engine data exits `3`, unexpected
internal failures exit `1`, and success exits `0`. Selectors and traversal
limits are explicit and bounded.

<a id="bounded-zip-model-pack-transport"></a>

## Bounded ZIP Model Pack transport

`@onto2d/model-pack/node` accepts a deliberately narrow, single-disk ZIP32
profile. An archive contains the same root-relative required files as a split
pack, optional known directory entries, and an optional `bundle.json`. Stored
and Deflate entries are accepted. ZIP64, encryption, data descriptors,
multi-disk archives, links, alternative Unicode path fields, duplicate or
unexpected paths, and unreferenced local bytes are rejected.

The loader bounds archive bytes, entry count, compressed entry bytes,
uncompressed entry bytes, total uncompressed bytes, and per-entry compression
ratio. It cross-checks central and local headers before asynchronous bounded
inflation, then checks declared length, CRC-32, UTF-8, and JSON. It never writes
extracted content to disk. The resulting values pass the existing Model Pack
reconstruction and identity verification.

`loadModelPackPath` dispatches only from the inspected filesystem type: a real
directory uses the directory loader and a real regular file uses the archive
loader. Symbolic links and other entry types fail closed. The CLI composes this
source loader and therefore accepts either representation without duplicating
transport logic.

<a id="bounded-browser-model-pack-loading"></a>

## Bounded browser Model Pack loading

`@onto2d/model-pack/browser` provides two bounded sources. The HTTP directory
loader accepts one explicit absolute HTTP(S) base URL without credentials,
query, or fragment and requests only the fixed required split JSON paths. An
optional policy also requires `bundle.json` to reproduce the split files
exactly. The raw bundle loader accepts a `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, or array-buffer
view containing JSON.

HTTP requests are sequential and use `GET`, `cache: "no-store"`,
`credentials: "same-origin"`, and `redirect: "error"`. Responses must have
status 200, the exact requested response URL, a JSON media type, a readable
byte stream, and a valid optional `Content-Length`. Declared and streamed
sizes are checked against per-file and cumulative limits before copying or
parsing, and UTF-8 and JSON parsing are strict. Declared length is not required
to equal the decoded stream size because a CDN can declare compressed transfer
bytes while Fetch exposes decompressed content. The decoded stream remains the
authoritative bounded input. Both sources pass their decoded values to the
existing full Model Pack reconstruction and hash/index verifier.

Options are plain data with a closed field set. Accessors and symbols are
rejected without invocation. The published entrypoint contains no Node
transport dependency and exposes matching TypeScript declarations. It reaches
identity primitives through the narrow `@onto2d/kernel/canonical` subpath,
whose portable synchronous SHA-256 is checked against independent Node
references and the frozen canonical fixtures. Model Studio now uses this
adapter before constructing any presentation view.

<a id="browser-model-pack-worker-protocol"></a>

## Browser Model Pack worker protocol

`@onto2d/model-pack/worker` publishes protocol version `1` with two operations:
`load-http-directory` and `load-bundle`. Requests, cancellations, results, and
errors use exact closed plain-data envelopes containing the protocol name,
version, bounded request ID, and operation-specific data. Unknown fields,
accessors, symbols, invalid identifiers, unsupported versions, duplicate active
IDs, excessive pending or active work, and values outside public browser limits
fail closed with stable `ModelPackError` codes.

The client supplies per-request timeouts and optional `AbortSignal`
cancellation. Cancellation removes the local request immediately and asks the
endpoint to abort its work; HTTP operations use an `AbortController`. Bundle
verification is synchronous after its bytes have been delivered, so
cancellation is cooperative and cannot preempt CPU work already executing in
that worker. Closing a client cancels every pending request, clears timers and
listeners, and terminates the worker only when `ownsWorker` was declared.

Bundle transport copies the caller's bytes by default. `transfer: "move"` is
accepted only for a complete `ArrayBuffer`, or a view spanning its complete
buffer, and explicitly detaches it. A copied buffer is internally transferred
after the copy to avoid a second copy. `Blob` remains structured-cloned and
cannot use move semantics.

The endpoint calls the unchanged `@onto2d/model-pack/browser` verifier. It
serializes only a bounded error name, code, message, and structured details;
stacks and arbitrary internal exceptions do not cross the boundary. A result
is structured-cloned back to the client, which checks the protocol envelope,
Model Pack format and identity fields, exact file layout, structured-data depth
and entry limits, then freezes it. It does not repeat Model Pack hashing on the
UI thread; the same-origin endpoint is the verification boundary.

Model Studio commits `assets/js/model-pack-worker.js`, a self-contained module
worker generated reproducibly from
`apps/model-studio/model-pack-worker-entry.js`. Repository checks build the
asset in memory and require byte-for-byte equality. Studio falls back to the
direct Bounded browser Model Pack loading verifier only for worker availability, protocol, timeout, or
transport failures. Errors from actual Model Pack verification propagate and
cannot trigger a second path that treats bad data as valid.

The protocol, structured clone, byte transfer, and generated deployment asset
are transport concerns. They do not enter canonical bytes, kernel behavior,
`rootHash`, or `manifestHash`.

<a id="verified-model-pack-cache"></a>

## Verified Model Pack cache

`@onto2d/model-pack/cache` exposes a verified cache and separate storage
adapters. The caller supplies an exact identity containing both `rootHash` and
`manifestHash`. The cache key contains the manifest hash; after verification,
both expected hashes must match. Aliases, labels, URLs, and model versions are
not cache keys.

Records contain canonical JSON for the complete transparent Model Pack. A read
does not trust the record: it applies the configured complete bundle verifier,
checks canonical bytes, reconstructs the actual identity, and compares it with
the expected exact identity. A write canonicalizes the candidate and sends the
result through that verifier before committing. A malformed, unverifiable, or
non-canonical record is deleted and reported as an invalid cache state so an
explicit loader may recover it. A valid record requested with a conflicting
root hash is not deleted; the request fails with an identity mismatch.

The default verifier is `loadModelPackBundle` from the bounded browser adapter.
Applications may inject the equivalent worker-backed verifier, but the worker
origin remains an application trust boundary as described by Browser Model Pack worker protocol. The
cache never interprets a storage read as proof of model validity.

The public in-memory and IndexedDB adapters implement the same closed storage
surface. A commit atomically writes the candidate and enforces explicit limits
for record count, record bytes, and total bytes. Deterministic first-in-first-
out eviction uses a monotonic insertion ordinal, preserving the ordinal when a
key is replaced. It does not use wall-clock time or mutate order on a read.
Database names and inventory scans are bounded, malformed stored metadata is
removed, version changes close stale connections, and late successful opens
after blocking or closure are closed immediately.

Loads for one exact cache key are coalesced. Remove waits for that key, while
clear and close wait for all active loads. Whether the cache owns and closes
its storage is explicit. Errors use stable `ModelPackError` codes, and custom
storage results are validated before use.

Model Studio declares the exact identity of its bundled release. It first asks
the verified cache, sends cached canonical bytes through the Model Pack worker,
and only then exposes the model to the view layer. A miss is fetched and
verified before storage. Cache storage availability and operational failures
may fall back to uncached loading; Model Pack verification and identity errors
do not. The UI distinguishes hit, miss, recovery, and unavailable storage for
diagnostics without changing scientific output.

Cache bytes, keys, insertion ordinals, IndexedDB metadata, eviction, and hit or
miss state do not enter canonical Model Pack bytes, `rootHash`, `manifestHash`,
kernel behavior, or analysis artifacts.

## Read-only Model Pack registry

`@onto2d/model-pack/registry` publishes a version-1 read-only registry and a
derived resolution contract. A registry is a flat bounded array of entries.
Each entry contains exactly `modelId`, `version`, `rootHash`, `manifestHash`,
and `packPath`. The model/version pair is unique. Identifiers use a narrow
ASCII grammar, paths are relative ASCII directories, and aliases, version
ranges, implicit latest selection, timestamps, and mutable state are absent.

Resolution always requires an explicit `modelId` and `version`. Entries are
normalized into model/version order and receive a domain-separated canonical
`registryHash`; authoring order does not affect that hash. A caller may provide
an expected registry hash. A matching pin produces `hash-pinned`; an unpinned
resolution is marked `transport-only`. A self-reported or transport-only hash
does not establish registry authority.

The resolved Model Pack URL is relative to the registry document. It must stay
on the same origin and within the registry directory. This first contract does
not support CDN indirection or cross-origin pack URLs. Those capabilities need
an explicit future policy rather than URL inference.

The HTTP resolver accepts one absolute HTTP(S) registry URL without
credentials, query, or fragment. It performs one `GET` with no credentials,
redirects, referrer, or HTTP caching. Status, response URL, JSON media type,
declared and decoded-stream byte limits, UTF-8, JSON, entry count, field sets,
identifiers, hashes, paths, and final URL length are bounded and fail closed.
The declared transfer length is not compared with decoded Fetch bytes, so
transparent CDN compression is supported. Options and direct registry values
reject accessors and unknown fields without invocation.

A registry resolution is discovery data, not Model Pack verification. The
separate `matchModelPackRegistryResolution` function binds a previously
verified pack to all four release coordinates: model ID, version, root hash,
and manifest hash. It does not duplicate pack reconstruction or hashing.

Model Studio pins the committed `models/registry.json`, resolves the explicit
Causal Emergence release, and then composes its URL and exact identity with the
existing worker and verified cache. Network candidates and cache records are
matched to the resolution before they can be stored or presented. Repository
checks verify every indexed bundle against its resolution and reject a stale
Studio registry pin.

Registry documents, registry hashes, paths, URLs, trust labels, and resolution
objects are operational metadata. They do not enter Model Pack canonical
bytes, `rootHash`, `manifestHash`, kernel behavior, or analysis artifacts.

## Lazy presentation over verified Model Packs

Add `@onto2d/view/lazy` as a browser-safe, dependency-free presentation
session. A session is created from explicit node and edge arrays plus the exact
model ID, version, root hash, and manifest hash. It exposes four bounded,
read-only operations:

- `descriptor` returns identity, counts, facets, and explicit capabilities;
- `catalog()` returns one deterministic page of lightweight node summaries;
- `neighborhood()` returns bounded lightweight nodes and edges suitable for
  deterministic layout;
- `inspect()` is the only operation that returns a complete node record and it
  bounds displayed relation summaries.

Every response carries the same exact model identity and uses the versioned
`onto2d-model-presentation` envelope. Catalogue and neighborhood results omit
the original `data` records. Limits, input shapes, unknown fields, accessors,
prototype-sensitive keys, closure, and missing nodes fail with stable
`ViewError` codes. Descriptor and projection envelopes have published JSON
Schemas.

Neighborhood edges retain optional string `role` and `assertion` fields.
Studio uses them in accessible edge labels and tooltips, alongside the declared
relation layer; absent numerical weights are not displayed as inferred values.

The view package still does not authenticate its input. Add the browser-safe
`@onto2d/engine/presentation` bridge as the authoritative constructor for
verified applications. It fully verifies the supplied Model Pack again and,
when supplied, matches the exact read-only registry resolution before creating
the view session. The bridge then copies all four verified identity coordinates
into every presentation response.

Model Studio keeps registry resolution, worker verification, and verified
cache reuse upstream. Only after those checks does it create the presentation
session. Explorer initially materializes 60 lightweight rows and obtains later
pages through an explicit `Load next` action. Graph changes request a bounded
neighborhood; node inspection requests the full record independently. A click
still inspects and a double-click still changes graph focus.

Presentation paging is operational only. It does not create a model, semantic
artifact, analysis population, cache identity, or alternate hash. Complete
analysis still requires a fully materialized and verified source population.
