# Foundations and graph construction

The construction principles below are research proposals. They require scoped
tests and independent scientific review.

The supplied texts contain a recognizable construction idea: configurations
become admissible, acquire persistent identity, and provide carriers and
constraints for another round of organization. The missing link is a justified
procedure from those principles to the individual catalogue decisions.
The papers and archive supply principles, definitions and proposed algorithms;
scientific justification for individual nodes and relations requires separate
evidence. The canonical graph implements a partial, explicitly scoped model.

## Scope and reproducibility

The supplied manuscripts and archive are research inputs. Their identities and
the finite mathematical witnesses are checked by `verify.py`. Current entities,
claims and proposed rules live in `references/canonical/graph.json`.

should not become evidence entries for the phenomena they discuss. Nor should
the graph's completeness be defined by collecting every archived suggestion.

## Mathematical findings that change representation

### F01 — Conditional geometry, not an unrestricted derivation

Topology pp. 6–10 chooses two primitive directions, a real symmetric bilinear
form, a nondegenerate quadratic derivative action, and restrictions excluding
other operators. Within a sufficiently explicit indefinite bilinear class,
the normal-form argument is meaningful. The assumptions about ordered
asymmetry and compensatory boundedness still need mathematical predicates
before they can establish that the indefinite class is forced.

Represent the assumptions, the conditional result and any physical
identification separately. The present catalogue's `0.16` also combines an
early premetric frame with the later analytic metric. Split those meanings:
otherwise a metric becomes an unexplained prerequisite of the directions from
which the paper later argues for it.

### F02 — An explicit operator/mass sign inconsistency

On p. 13 the paper simultaneously gives:

```text
(24) Box psi + m2 psi = 0
(25) Box = -d2_t + d2_x
(26) m2 = omega^2 - k^2
psi = A exp(i(kx - omega t))
```

Substitution into (24)–(25) gives
`(omega^2 - k^2 + m2) psi = 0`, hence `m2 = k^2 - omega^2`.
For `k=1`, `omega=2`, Eq. (26) gives `m2=3`, but the residual coefficient is
`6`. The conflict also occurs in Eqs. (8)–(9), p. 8.

The existing [Phase-B model](../../../cases/level-0-oscillator/model-v1.json)
uses `d2_t psi - d2_x psi + m2 psi = 0`, which is consistent with its
dispersion relation. It therefore verifies its declared convention, not all
three source equations simultaneously. Repair the source convention across
the metric, action, equation and dispersion together in a future revision;
changing one sign in isolation may move the inconsistency elsewhere.

### F03 — Stationarity, a minimum and stability need separate tests

Topology pp. 14–15 and 33–34 moves between stationary action, minimized action
and stable configurations. These statements are not interchangeable. For the
displayed indefinite quadratic action, variations depending on time and space
can have opposite signs. For example, on a periodic square, the real
variations `epsilon sin(t)` and `epsilon sin(2x)` with `m2=3` contribute
`-4 pi^2 epsilon^2` and `+pi^2 epsilon^2`. The quadratic part is indefinite.
Stationarity eliminates the first variation; it does not make this second
variation positive or prove dynamical persistence.

Keep equation satisfaction, extremum selection and stability as separate
results. A deliberately defined nonnegative selection score may be minimized,
but it is a different mathematical object from the indefinite action.

### F04 — Three is conditional on the closure definition

On pp. 16–17 the dyad is a segment and the triad is the first genuine loop.
That is consistent with an **undirected simple graph without self-loops**.
A finite census of all 11 labelled graphs on one through three vertices
recovers three as the smallest cycle size. Directed graphs admit two-cycles,
and other relation models have different primitives.

This is a relative structural minimum. It does not prove that every stable
physical object needs three components, that a three-body system is necessarily
irreducible in the required dynamical sense, or that a support triangle models
an irreducible three-way interaction. A three-way coupling may need a hyperedge
or an explicit rule instance; its pairwise projection loses joint semantics.

### F05–F06 — Balance and density do not establish localized closure

The balance conditions on pp. 19–20 and 25 are insufficient on their own.
Take amplitudes one, `k=(1,2,-3)` and `omega=(2,3,-5)`. Both sums vanish,
but the sum of the three plane waves is spatially periodic. At every fixed
time its squared norm per `2pi` interval is `6pi`; over the whole line the
norm diverges. Removing any one mode leaves `4pi` per period, not zero.
Thus balance does not imply localization, and `|Psi|^2` does not necessarily
collapse when a constituent of the proposed closure is removed.

This counterexample targets the claimed sufficiency of the balance equations.
It does not purport to solve an independently specified nonlinear self-binding
model. Such a model is precisely an additional obligation.

Split `0.7` into local density `rho` and integrated quantity `Gamma`, with
support, measure, normalization and transformation group. For fixed support
and measure, global phase invariance is directly justified. Conservation in
time, localization and persistence require additional dynamics and evidence.

### F07 — Nonlinear coupling is a model proposal with negative case evidence

Topology pp. 25–26 defines `Psi=sum psi_i` while writing a cubic term in the
individual fields. The independent variation variables, constraints and
projection to a single effective equation must be specified. Neither the name
of the coupling nor a stationary equation establishes bounded stable solutions.

The existing [boundedness preflight](../../../cases/level-0-oscillator/PHASE_C_PREFLIGHT.md)
has a negative result for its declared free cubic potential. Stabilized
follow-ups use additional model assumptions; the
[integrated portable study](../../../cases/level-0-oscillator/LEVEL_ZERO_VALIDATION_V3.md)
admits no object-qualified CRT candidate. This supports rejection within those
specified models, not a theorem that every possible completion fails.

The proposed graph preserves the CRT carrier **class and hypothesis** but
does not manufacture a successful instance or feed failed candidates into the
ensemble gate.

### F08–F12 — Coordinates and later steps remain explicit obligations

- `0.7` and `0.8` are in catalogue Phase C; the paper develops density and
  objecthood by the end of Phase B, then formalizes nodes in Phase C and later
  refers to nodes formed there. Preserve the two source coordinates and the
  ambiguity. Neither is automatically kernel derivation depth.
- `E=hbar omega` and `p=hbar k` do not, by themselves, make continuous
  frequencies or wave numbers discrete. `0.17` needs a separate spectrum or
  admissibility rule.
- A nonzero inter-node coupling does not automatically prove collective
  stability. A list of nodes, an ensemble and a promoted carrier are distinct
  objects of evaluation.
- The p. 34 selector leaves metric definitions and coefficients open. A
  selected candidate needs a specified cohort and uncertainty/sensitivity
  record; tied minima remain alternatives.
- The named `0.20–0.23` directional branch has no sufficiently specific
  derivation in the fully reviewed topology paper. Perturbative persistence
  supplies a related question for `0.21`, not a proof of the full branch.
  Keep these proposals available with their missing definitions recorded.

The named Level-5/6/7 references in LifeSynth v3 do resolve to current labels
for endocrine regulation, sleep–wake cycles, neurovascular coupling, social
norms, digital social networks and cultural transmission. This verifies label
alignment only, not the proposed applications or the 2025 historical versions.

The process/relator distinction can be checked against the project's intended
external vocabulary: [gUFO Relator and Event definitions](https://nemo-ufes.github.io/gufo/).
That specification supports semantic review; it does not certify this proposed
OntoUML extension.

## What “minimal” should mean

Choose the target property and comparison regime before searching. A useful
support formulation is:

```text
P(H; context, dynamics, observation protocol) holds
and no admissible proper subconfiguration H' of H preserves that P.
```

This is **inclusion minimality**. A smallest cost or cardinality solution is a
separate global optimization within a declared candidate universe. Testing
only single deletions does not prove global minimality when predicates are
non-monotone or substitutions are allowed. A minimal predictive description
is different again; its cost concerns retained information or description,
not necessarily physical constituent count. Stationary action is a fourth
notion and cannot stand in for the other three.

Every minimality claim needs: candidate universe, target, scope and boundary,
allowed edits/substitutions, cost or partial order, evaluation protocol,
search bounds, and all surviving tied alternatives. None may be inferred from
an attractive geometry score or the current catalogue's size.

An external methodological precedent is the minimal predictive representation
in [Shalizi and Crutchfield, Theorem 2](https://arxiv.org/html/cond-mat/9907176v2).
Their complexity measure and predictive-sufficiency assumptions are essential;
the result does not establish a universal minimum of physical components or
identify intervention mechanisms from a time series.

## How stable complexity can supply effective rules

The paper's strongest constructive idea is Eq. (55), p. 32: the completed
configuration changes the admissibility domain for the next cycle. Make that
change a record that can fail verification.

For a proposed macro state `y=q(x)`, start with the obligation

```text
q(T(x,u)) approximately equals T_macro(q(x), omega(u))
```

on a declared domain and time scale. `q` maps states, `omega` maps the allowed
inputs/interventions, and `T_macro` must predict without consulting discarded
microstate information. When different microstates with the same `q(x)` have
different relevant futures, refine the macro state, preserve relevant history,
or report that this effective description is not closed. A useful macro
coordinate also needs a task/observable and comparison with simpler alternatives;
an arbitrary constant map would otherwise pass a vacuous closure test.

For probabilistic causal models compare the forward-mapped distribution
`q_* P_micro(. | do(u))` with `P_macro(. | do(omega(u)))` in the same macro
space. Specify supported intervention sets, sampling uncertainty and tolerance.
Do not assume an inverse of a many-to-one map. This design is motivated by
[Rubenstein et al., Section 4.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00819), whose exact
transformations also require a surjective order-preserving intervention map.
Our approximate contract remains a proposal and does not inherit their exact
theorem merely by using similar notation.

The checker contains a deliberately small constructive illustration. With
micro-update `(a,b)->(b,b)`, `q(a,b)=b` admits the macro rule `y->y`.
For `q(a,b)=a`, states `(0,0)` and `(0,1)` have the same macro state but
different next macro states; none of the four deterministic binary macro
functions works. This illustrates how to accept or reject an effective rule,
not the emergence of CRTs, consciousness or a new physical law.

The promoted interface should record its carriers, valid operations,
constraints and scope of approximation. It may restrict or enable higher-level
interactions through the organization of the underlying system. Modification
of a fundamental law is a stronger hypothesis requiring separate evidence.
Boundary conditions, effective parameters, emergent dynamical laws and changes
to a software rulebook must not be conflated.

Structural geometry can then help propose configurations, measure their
organization and compare alternatives. It becomes part of the test only after
its relation semantics and lengths have a defined interpretation. The present
shadow flow changes lengths on a fixed source topology; it supplies neither
the nonlinear CRT dynamics nor the missing empirical construction law.
